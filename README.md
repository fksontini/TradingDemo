# TradingDemo

This example demonstrates how to run a simple trading simulation using the `abstract-trader` engine.

## Building

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```

The executable will be placed in `bin/`.

## Running

```bash
./bin/abstract-trader
```

Make sure the required runtime dependencies such as GLFW and OpenGL are installed on your system.
